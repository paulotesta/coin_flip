# Coin Flip

## _Sample Python game_

Coin Flip is my first attempt at python programing.

## Instructions

To start the program you'll need python 3 installed on your system and type:

```sh
python3 coin_flip.py
```

The user must first choose between heads or tails, typing either option. After that the program will randomly choose beetwen them and anounce if the user got it right ("you win") or wrong ("you lose")

At any time, the user can close the program by typing "quit"
